# Code of Conduct

## Purpose
We commit to fostering a welcoming, safe, and collaborative community. This Code of Conduct sets expectations for all contributors and helps us create a respectful environment for learning, building, and problem solving together.

## Our Standards
- Treat everyone with respect and empathy; be open to varying viewpoints and experiences.
- Provide constructive feedback, focusing on ideas rather than individuals.
- Accept responsibility for mistakes, learn from them, and move forward.
- Use inclusive language and avoid harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks.
- Respect privacy and confidentiality when information is shared in confidence.

Unacceptable behavior includes harassment, hate speech, discriminatory remarks, threats, stalking, publication of others’ private information, and any other conduct that would make someone feel unsafe or unwelcome.

## Scope
This Code applies to all community spaces—online or offline—including repositories, issues, pull requests, code review, documentation, forums, chat channels, conferences, and related events.

## Responsibilities and Enforcement
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code. They may take appropriate corrective action in response to unacceptable behavior, including warning, temporary suspension, or permanent removal from community spaces.

If you witness or experience a violation of this Code, please report it via a repository issue marked as confidential or by contacting the maintainers privately. Reports will be reviewed promptly and kept confidential to the extent possible.

## Alignment with the Project License
By participating in this project you agree to follow this Code of Conduct. By submitting contributions—including issues, comments, patches, and pull requests—you confirm that your contributions are your own work (or that you have the right to share them) and that they are provided under the open-source license covering this repository (see `LICENSE`).
